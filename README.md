ðŸ“˜ Rock vs Mine Predictor
A simple yet powerful machine learning project to classify sonar signals as either rock or mine using the Sonar Dataset from the UCI repository.


ðŸš€ Project Summary
This project uses Logistic Regression to detect whether a given sonar return signal is from a metal cylinder (mine) or a rock. It's a binary classification problem using the scikit-learn ML pipeline.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used
Dataset: Sonar Dataset (from UCI ML repository)
Features: 60 numeric features (energy values of sonar signals)
Target: Rock or Mine

ðŸ§  ML Pipeline
âœ… Data loading using Pandas

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (shape, types, distribution)

âœ… Data preprocessing:

Label Encoding for target (Rock=0, Mine=1)

Train-Test Split (90/10)

StandardScaler normalization

âœ… Model Training using Logistic Regression

âœ… Model Evaluation: Accuracy score and predictions

ðŸ“ˆ Accuracy Achieved
Training Accuracy: ~83%

Test Accuracy: ~76%
